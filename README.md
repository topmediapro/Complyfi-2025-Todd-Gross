## Complyfi 2025 Review & OTO

### What Is COMPLYFI? Complyfi Makes Your Business Compliant With GDPR, DMA, Google Consent Mode V2, and more. 

Complyfi is a professional Consent Management platform that protects the rights of your website visitors and protects your business from expensive lawsuits. With Complyfi you can give visitors the choice they need about Cookie management and tracking.
It will keep record of your visitors’ choices and also allow them to manage and change it anytime they want. This is mandated by the GDPR & DMA laws that apply in the US and internationally.
Complyfi lets you comply with the requirement of presenting information about your DPO (Data Protection Officer). It gives you 100% compliance, 100% peace of mind with total security.

Google has made it mandatory to collect consent on YOUR SITE before you can build audiences and run ads to the audiences. This is called Consent Mode V2.
There are also laws like GDPR which have been around for a while which mandate you to allow users to control their data and the amount of tracking you do. If you don’t let them control it, you are not complying with the law which can result in hefty fines, especially if your website is reaching out Globally.

That’s why you see Consent screens on nearly every big website you go to. They want to protect their business from legal liability.
Cyril launched WP GDPR Fix some years ago and gave Wordpress users an effective solution for GDPR and consent management. That tool was a massive success but it worked only for Wordpress.

Now Cyril developed Complyfi that works on every website no matter what the platform and manages consent in a 100% compliant manner.

With Complyfi, you can instantly scan, fix, and manage website compliance for GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and other strict privacy laws—without hiring an attorney or spending hours figuring it out yourself.

Because here’s the best part: You can offer this as a service to other businesses who are just as lost when it comes to compliance. Every website needs this, and most people will happily pay for a fast, done-for-you solution rather than risk losing their business.
Complyfi makes compliance easy, fast, and profitable. But this exclusive launch offer won’t last forever.
